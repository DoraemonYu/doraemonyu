### Doraemon says Hello to you 👋 
o(∩_∩)o My name is Yangzhou Yu. You can call me by my nickname, Doraemon. 

I come from China, and I am a senior software engineer with 16 years development experience and 10 years work experience.   
Simultaneously, I am a System-Architect and a MCSD (certified by Microsoft). 

In my leisure time, I love to read books on science and art, sometimes play piano alone, and sometimes travel with my friends.   
Furthermore, I run a non-profit personal studio named [*幻蓝工作室*](https://yuyangzhou.name). 

BTW, my nickname as you see, I am a big fan of *Doraemon* \~\\(≧▽≦)/\~
