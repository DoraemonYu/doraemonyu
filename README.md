### Doraemon says Hi to you 👋 
o(∩_∩)o Hello. My name is Yangzhou Yu. You can call me by my nickname, Doraemon. 

I come from China, and I am a senior software engineer with 16 years development experience and 10 years work experience.   
Simultaneously, I am a System-Architect and a MCSD (certified by Microsoft). 

In my leisure time, except daily developments, I like reading books, cooking, traveling and science.   
Furthermore I run a non-profit personal studio named *幻蓝工作室*.   
BTW, my nickname as you see, I am a big fan of *Doraemon* \~\\(≧▽≦)/\~
